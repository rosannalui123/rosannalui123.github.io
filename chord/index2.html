                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>
                    Current methods of communications for musicians in Seattle are through Craigslist, Facebook, and Reddit which are often full of spam and flakey musicians who never pull through. It is tough to identify musicians who share a genuine interest in you and
                    find a practice space to devote energy to musical projects. As a solution, we developed Chordinate, which is a mobile app that connects local musicians for jam sessions, music recommendation, and building a new friendship.

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <p>
                    Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, Paper and Pen
                </p>
                <h4>Contribution</h4>
                <p>
                    UX Research, Visual Design, High Fidelity Mockups, Interviews, Paper Prototype, User Interface Design, Questionnaire

                <h4>Assumption</h4>
                <p>
                    How can we build an app that will ensure that musicians would connect and bond with other musicians more easily than Craigslist, Facebook, and Reddit? I collaborated with local musicians in the area in order to understand their perspective and feelings
                    about meeting other musicians.
                </p>
                <h4>Research and Insight</h4>
                <p>
                    Through our interviews and questionnaire, we discovered that there is a huge practice space crisis in Seattle. We could build an app that connects musicians but how can we enable and empower them to create music. We decided to integrate a function into
                    the app where musicians can find practice spaces after chatting. If we connect people who have the space to jam with people who don't, then we can strengthen the music community by solving the practice space crisis and give musicians
                    a place to social network.

            <p>People can also use the Chordinate app to listen to musician's music in their area, find musicians and practice spaces locally.
