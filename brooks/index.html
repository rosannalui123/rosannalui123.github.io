                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bee Adventurous is an augmented reality game that addresses the negative perception of bees in children by encouraging children to go outside and learn about their environmental importance. Working with three other designers, we collaborated closely with
                        educators, beekeepers, gardeners, farmers, and environmental organizations, who informed the content and shaped the direction of our project.

                    <h4>Challenge</h4>
                    <p>
                        How can we effectively change children's negative perception of bees? Would encouraging children to empathize with bees or understanding their importance in our biodiversity shape that belief?

                <h4>Analyze Current Perceptions</h4>
                <p>
                    We interviewed 15 beekeepers, who have experience teaching children about bees. In addition, we distributed 2 questionnaires through bee related forums and social media sites, one for people with little interaction with bees with 140 responses and the
                    other for beekeepers with 55 responses. We discovered in the questionnaires that many people understand the importance of bees in our biodiversity but they had a negative experience as a child that shaped their current perception.

                <p>
                    By exploring different top games and websites, we discovered that the way bees are represented are not engaging to children. We found that many websites that encourage children to learn about bees were not accessible to early learners, such as providing
                    an overwhelming amount of information. Moreover, most video games that featured bees did not have much educational value except the association with bees and honey.

                <div>Children could overcome their fears about bees through positive experience by being around them in nature. This could happen by following the 'Bee safe rules' that many beekeepers teach to children based on interviews with educators from
                    the West Seattle Bee Garden and 21 Acres. </div>

                <div>Children can start learning about bees at the earliest 3 years old but the best age range to teach children about empathy is from 7- 9 years old based on our interviews with educators at the Seattle Science Center. </div>

                <h4>Developing Bee Adventurous</h4>
                <p>
                    Based on our research, we focused on building an educational augmented reality game that puts children outside into their local parks, so they can safely learn to observe bees from a distance to change their perception. In order to educate children on
                    how to observe bees, we are incorporating the bee safe rules into the game and created the main character Beetrice to have a slight attitude to make her less approachable.

                        We tested our app at two bees themed festival: Bee Sweets to the Earth and Bee Fest with a total of 52 participants. In order to encourage people to visit our booth, we created stickers, bags, banners, buttons, and informational flyer with our branding.<br>

                        The response we got from our users that the application was easy to navigate and was visually appealing. Many adults and children also reported that the game's main character, Beetrice, is adorable. A majority of the children were genuinely concerned
                        about Beetrice's wellbeing, and many children asked follow-up questions about her welfare. The children's interest in Beetrice indicates the possible effects of using an augmented reality game to help children learn about and empathize
                        with bees. <br>
